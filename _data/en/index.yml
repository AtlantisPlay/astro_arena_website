      **Astro Arena** is an exhilarating multiplayer game set in a dynamic 2D space arena where players engage in team-based battles inspired by the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors mechanics. The game blends strategic combat, resource management, and powerful abilities, appealing to casual gamers who enjoy competitive, fast-paced environments.

      ## The Concept

      In Astro Arena, players choose between three character types: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, creating a thrilling mix of chase, tactical maneuvers, and skillful escapes. The classic dynamic is present: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock. Combined with fast-paced arena combat, this leads to intense gameplay where quick reflexes and strategic thinking are key.

      ## Game Mechanics

      The core mode is a team-based battle, where players compete to gather resources scattered across the arena or defeat opponents to gain an advantage. As teams collect resources, they earn points, which can be exchanged for temporary abilities like invisibility or increased speed. These abilities can turn the tide of battle, allowing players to outsmart their opponents or escape danger.

      ## The Development Team

      **AtlantisTeam Development Ltd**, under the brand of AtlantisPlay, was founded in 2019 by a team of game development professionals. With locations in Cyprus, Israel, and Ukraine, the team is made up of experienced developers, artists, and designers passionate about creating engaging gaming experiences.

      Since its inception, the company has developed numerous games for various clients, ranging from large-scale Match-3 and Merge puzzles to games of other genres. Creating their own game has been a dream of the founders, and with the drive to explore new technologies, the company conceptualized Astro Arena in late 2022. Using Godot Engine and inspired by Rock, Paper, Scissors mechanics, they embarked on this exciting project.

      Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing war in Ukraine, where the development team is based, the team has worked relentlessly to bring Astro Arena to life.

      ## Release Information

      **Astro Arena** is scheduled for release in late 2024 on Steam for Windows PC. The game will be free to play, with in-game purchases available for character customization and exclusive abilities. Players can wishlist the game on Steam to stay informed about the latest updates and announcements.

      Technological progress, just as expected, did not delay the collapse of the Earth civilization, but brought it even closer.

      From the Old Earth, overpopulated and dying, five Arks took off to different Earth-type planets. Each of them was carrying 500 million colonists and about a billion intelligent robot servants.

      Four Arks disappeared in the darkness of space. The fifth one safely reached its destination and successfully landed on a planet suitable for colonization. Thus, humans found a new home.

      Then a problem revealed itself. It turned out that over the years of the sub-light travel, the Ark's databases were damaged, or perhaps they were filled in a hurry.

      The AI of the Fifth Ark retained all knowledge of science and technology, but lost almost the entire array of data about the humanities and culture. Only a huge library of chivalric romance and adventure novels was somehow preserved in the database.

      Thus, generations later, humanity, having lost access to other cultural sources, gradually turned to technofeudalism.

      Quite unexpectedly, this turned out to be a good solution for survival in the new world. The descendants of the descendants of earthlings made great progress in robotics, but socially and culturally remained at the level of the Earth's 14th century. Society was divided into three guilds, each of which kept its secrets and formed a corporation impenetrable to outsiders.

      The Artisan Union, whose symbol was a pair of Scissors, was involved in manufacturing and production.

      The Scriptor Conclave, whose banners bore the sign of Paper, traditionally specialized in information processing.

      And the Guild of Belt Miners with the Rock on their shield mined mineral-rich asteroids.

      Inevitable feudal conflicts were usually fought with the help of high-tech robotic Knights, who cut through interplanetary space on their space steed-bikes. The Knights proved terrifyingly effective, as they were virtually indestructible and, in addition, controlled by human Operators located in safe fortresses.

      Once a year, the System declares a truce and a great mass tournament, La Grande Mêlée.

      The best Operators of the three rival Guilds send their robot Knights, and yesterday's rivals unite into two teams and put aside their differences for a while to determine who is the worthiest, the most valiant and the most skilled in controlling their combat machines.
