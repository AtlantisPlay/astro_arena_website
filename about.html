            <h1>About Astro Arena</h1>
            <div class="article-text">
                <p><strong>Astro Arena</strong> is an exhilarating multiplayer game set in a dynamic 2D space arena
                    where players engage in team-based battles inspired by the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors mechanics.
                    The game blends strategic combat, resource management, and powerful abilities, appealing to casual
                    gamers who enjoy competitive, fast-paced environments.</p>

                <h2>The Concept</h2>

                <p>In Astro Arena, players choose between three character types: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Each type has
                    its own strengths and weaknesses, creating a thrilling mix of chase, tactical maneuvers, and
                    skillful escapes. The classic dynamic is present: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and
                    Paper covers Rock. Combined with fast-paced arena combat, this leads to intense gameplay where quick
                    reflexes and strategic thinking are key.</p>

                <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>

                <p>The core mode is a team-based battle, where players compete to gather resources scattered across the
                    arena or defeat opponents to gain an advantage. As teams collect resources, they earn points, which
                    can be exchanged for temporary abilities like invisibility or increased speed. These abilities can
                    turn the tide of battle, allowing players to outsmart their opponents or escape danger.</p>

                <h2>The Development Team</h2>

                <p><strong>AtlantisTeam Development Ltd</strong>, under the brand of AtlantisPlay, was founded in 2019
                    by a team of game development professionals. With locations in Cyprus, Israel, and Ukraine, the team
                    is made up of experienced developers, artists, and designers passionate about creating engaging
                    gaming experiences.</p>

                <p>Since its inception, the company has developed numerous games for various clients, ranging from
                    large-scale Match-3 and Merge puzzles to games of other genres. Creating their own game has been a
                    dream of the founders, and with the drive to explore new technologies, the company conceptualized
                    Astro Arena in late 2022. Using Godot Engine and inspired by Rock, Paper, Scissors mechanics,
                    they embarked on this exciting project.</p>

                <p>Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing war in Ukraine, where the development team is based, the
                    team has worked relentlessly to bring Astro Arena to life.</p>

                <h2>Release Information</h2>

                <p><strong>Astro Arena</strong> is scheduled for release in late 2024 on Steam for Windows PC. The game
                    will be free to play, with in-game purchases available for character customization and exclusive
                    abilities. Players can wishlist the game on Steam to stay informed about the latest updates and
                    announcements.</p>
